# Shuffleboard Textbox Widget

A thing nobody knew they needed because they assumed it was already there.

This is a widget to include a TextArea widget into Shuffleboard (from WPILib).

### Installing

The best way to build and install this code is to follow the instructions in the 
[WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/shuffleboard/custom-widgets/creating-plugins.html#building-plugin) 
on creating a Shuffleboard plugin. When you get to the point of placing the plugin, put 
this code into the `example-plugins/textbox-widget` directory. Follow the instructions 
about `settings.gradle` in the base Shuffleboard project you downloaded, and then skip to 
"Deploying Plugin To Shuffleboard"

### Dependencies

Nothing that isn't already included with with the git repository. Literally all this does 
is add a TextArea widget. Not a lot of heavy lifting there.
